I have plenty of features planned for this one, here is the list:

- Select number of faces and number of dice to roll
- Advanced mode for RPG-style rolls (succeess, crit, fail)
- Random.org rolling option
- PWA (working offline)
- Roll history
- Themes
- Roll presets
- Profiles
- Multiple dice types in a single roll
- Device synchronization
- Sister projects
  - Multi-user real-time dice rolling service
  - Discord bot (future integrations with other platforms)
